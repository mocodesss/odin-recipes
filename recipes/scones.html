    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Honestly, get ready for the best chocolate chip scones you've ever eaten.
      They taste doughy but in the best way. You cannot say "no" to these, no
      matter the discipline you have around food. Consider yourself warned!
      Enjoy at any time of the day. Will likely be gone within their first 24
      hours on this earth.

      Total prep time: I've seen Michelle D do it in about 8 minutes, but it
      will likely take you about 20-25 minutes. If you are a novice, it will
      take you longer, but that's on you. Total baking time: 12-14 minutes.
