    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A moist, dense cake with a little zing and crunch. I believe this recipe
      was adapted from a NYT recipe. Before this cake, I was grossed out by
      carrot cakes, but I would gladly celebrate any and every occasion with
      this lovely, delectable cake. And, there are carrots in it so it's healthy! ;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Caution, this cake will take you all day to make. Maybe more experienced
      bakers can make it in less than 3 hours, but it has always taken me 5-6
      hours from start to finish. But that's okay, it's become more about the
      journey for me anyways, though the destination is wildly delicious.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups of <strong>peeled, graded carrots</strong></li>
      <li>
        2 and 1/2 to 3 cups of <strong>sifted icing sugar</strong> (frosting)
      </li>
      <li>2 cups of <strong>flour</strong></li>
      <li>2 cups of lightly packed <strong>brown sugar</strong></li>
      <li>1 and 1/4 cups of <strong>olive oil</strong></li>
      <li>1 and 1/4 cups of <strong>chopped, toasted pecans</strong></li>
      <li>
        8 ounces of <strong> room temperature cream cheese</strong> (frosting)
      </li>
      <li>4 <strong>eggs</strong></li>
      <li>
        6 tablespoons of <strong>room temperature, unsalted butter</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        1/4 of a cup of <strong>dried, chopped apricots</strong> (can add extra,
        chopped or whole to top as decoration)
      </li>
      <li>1/4 of a cup of <strong>pure maple syrup</strong> (frosting)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of <strong>peeled, minced ginger</strong></li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of <strong>cinnamon</strong></li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of <strong>baking soda</strong></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of <strong>vanilla</strong></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of <strong>salt</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350&#176F.</li>
      <li>
        Butter two 9 inch diameter cake pans and line bottom with parchment
        paper. Butter and flour the parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, with an electric mixer (or vigorous whisking) beat
        together sugar and oil. Whisk in eggs 1 at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour mixture and mix on low speed until well blended. Add vanilla
        extract.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in carrots, pecans, ginger and apricots.</li>
      <li>
        Divide batter between prepared pans and bake cakes until tester inserted
        into centre comes out clean, about <strong>40 minutes</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        When done baking, cool cakes in pans for about 15 minutes and then turn
        out onto racks, peel off parchment paper, and cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the frosting, beat together cream cheese and butter until fluffy
        with an electric mixer (or vigorous whisking). Then beat in the maple syrup. Finally, at a low
        speed, add icing sugar 1/2 cup at a time, until a thick, smooth icing
        forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        On chilled cake, place 1 cake layer on platter. Spread with about half
        of the icing. Top with second layer and spread remaining icing on top of
        cake. Only frost the side with a thin layer of frosting. Add any extra
        nuts, dried fruit, etc to the top as decoration. Cover loosely with
        plastic wrap and chill.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
